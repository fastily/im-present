Simple utility which moves your mouse by 1 pixel and then back at a specified interval.  Useful for pretending to be at your computer and fooling apps which track your productivity.

## Installation
```bash
pip install im-present
```

## Usage
```
usage: __main__.py [-h] [-i secs] [-j secs] [-t secs]

periodically shakes the mouse pointer to prove you're here

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  -i secs     number of seconds to wait in between mouse movements. Defaults to 600.
  -j secs     number of seconds to wait in between mouse jitters. Defaults to 0.5.
  -t secs     if set, exit after this many seconds have elapsed from the time this program was first started.
```

## Run
If installed with `pip`, you'll get a CLI alias, `present`, otherwise you'll have to invoke the program with `python3 -m present`

```bash
# Run indefinitely until quit (ctrl+c)
present

# Wiggle the mouse every 30s and wait 2s before moving it back to the original posotion
present -i 30 -j 2
```

👉 `im-present` also checks if you're using your computer (i.e. did you manually move the mouse), in which case the mouse will not be moved until the next interval.
